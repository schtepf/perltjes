DESCRIPTION

    When TeX/LaTeX is used to format a document, many temporary files are
    created in the same directory as the source file. Unfortunately, TeX
    does not offer an easy way to remove these temporary files when they are
    no longer needed. The Hoover program was designed to take over this job.
    It also deletes Emacs backup and cache files.

    Type "perldoc Hoover" for more information and usage instructions.


INSTALLATION

    Adjust the path to the Perl interpreter (#!/usr/bin/perl) in the first 
    line of the "Hoover" script, if necessary.  Then copy the script to a
    directory in your search path.  Typical installation directories are
    "/usr/local/bin" for a site-wide installation (usually requires
    administrator privileges) and "~/bin" for a personal installation.

    On most Unix systems (including Linux and Mac OS X), you can install
    Hoover with one of the following commands:

      install -m 755 Hoover /usr/local/bin

    or

      install -m 755 Hoover ~/bin
